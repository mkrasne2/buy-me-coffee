# Buy Me a Coffee

I put this project together to teach myself how to host a decentralized React application on IPFS.

## Technologies Used

Ethers.js, React, IPFS, Fleek.co to connect Github to deploy the application to IPFS, ENS to point my .eth address to the application on IPFS:
https://markzachary.eth.link/ (if using a browser that requires DNS-over-HTTPS server)
markzachary.eth (if using a browser like Brave)
